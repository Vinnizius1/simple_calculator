#### As a user I would like to be able to provide two numbers and one of the four basic operations (add(+), subtract(-), multiply(\*), divide(/)) and then see the result of that operation based on my input of two numbers.

Example:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | :----: |
| 1     |   3    |
| 2     |        |
| +     |        |
